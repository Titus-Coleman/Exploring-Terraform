### Exploring Terraform

This repo is primarily for personal use as a reference to provisioning cloud infrastructure using Terraform. Expect to find various working templates as I learn and discover Terraform.

## Getting started

These are all working templates, meaning they launch the correct resource coded in the template for that specific cloud provider (mostly AWS). However, they are primarily for testing/learning so the complete architecture may require added details.

To get started, make sure your cloud provider credentials are added in either CLI or hardcoded in the template - then:

1. terraform init
2. terraform plan
3. terraform apply
